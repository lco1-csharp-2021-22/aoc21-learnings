# aoc21-learnings

As with most years, this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) is setting problems for which there are some clever solutions which might not be obvious, or for which there are interesting problems which just need grind. 

## Grid Representation 

  - [**Day 5**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5) parts 1 and 2 - representing a grid and using co-ordinates to draw lines (horizontal and vertical in part one, with gradient +/- 1 in part two): how to represent which points have been visited when given a list of lines endpoints. 
  - [**Day 9**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9) part 2 - region filling in a grid, possibly using a queue: for a given grid with known regions, how to work out which points belong to which regions. 

## Permutations 

  - [**Day 8**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8) part 2 - generating permutations (for a brute force method): how to generate all permutations for a given list. 

(Obviously to an extent these are based on how ***I*** solve them.) 

Submit your solutions for these problems; join the [SPS leaderboard]() (code: `805152-f79c4ba5`) if you haven't already).
